# Gym Backend
Project developed for University with the goal of creating a microservices application for training reservations. We have **three services** developed in **Java Spring** orchestrated through an **API Gateway** implemented with **Zuul** and **Service Discovery** facilitated by **Eureka** to ensure seamless communication between microservices.

**Services:**
1. **User Service**: focuses on user management, offering functionalities for user registration and login. 
2. **Reservation Service**: responsible for handling the intricacies of making and canceling appointments and reservations.
3. **Notification Service**: designed to send timely and relevant emails to users, providing updates on reservations, appointment confirmations, and other important information.
